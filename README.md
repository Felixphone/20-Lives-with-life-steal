# Wool-s-20-Lives-with-life-steal
A cool minecraft datapack that gives each player 20 lives.
Cool death effects and great opportunity for lore.
Once a player loses all their lives they become a ghost.
Also includes optional settings for life steal where players can gain more lives.

Feel free to make any changes or share with friends!

Contains experimental features (Ghost phasing) so be carefull.


To setup:
1. load datapack into world folder under datapacks
2. load up world
3. run the command /reload
4. click on the bold text to obtain the command book

Most options can be configured through this book and it should step you through the process.

Enjoy! :)
