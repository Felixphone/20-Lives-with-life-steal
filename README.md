# Wool-s-20-Lives-with-life-steal
A cool minecraft datapack that gives each player 20 lives.
Cool death effects and great opportunity for lore.
Once a player loses all their lives they become a ghost.
Also includes optional settings for life steal where players can gain more lives.

Feel free to make any changes or share with friends!

Contains experimental feature: Ghost phasing (disabled by defalt, but can be configured in command book) so be carefull when enabeling on large servers!
