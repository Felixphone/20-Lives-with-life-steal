# Wool-s-20-Lives-with-life-steal
A cool minecraft datapack that gives each player 20 lives.
Cool death effects and great opportunity for lore.
Once a player loses all their lives they become a ghost.
Also includes optional settings for life steal where players can gain more lives.

Feel free to make any changes or share with friends!

Contains experimental features (Ghost phasing) so be carefull.
