# 20-Lives-with-life-steal
A cool minecraft datapack that gives each player 20 lives.
Cool death effects and great opportunity for lore.
Once a player loses all their lives they become a ghost.
Also includes optional settings for life steal where players can gain more lives.

Feel free to make any changes or share with friends!
